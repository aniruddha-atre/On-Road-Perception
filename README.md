# On-Road Perception using Deep Learning

This project focuses on visual perception for autonomous driving, covering two core tasks:

a) 2D Object Detection using YOLOv8  
b) Semantic Segmentation using Transformer-based SegFormer

The emphasis is on model training quality, evaluation metrics, and visual results, following practices used in real-world autonomous driving pipelines.

## 1️⃣ Object Detection — YOLOv8

Trained on road-scene style set-up - KITTI dataset

Detects vehicles, pedestrians, cyclists, and traffic-relevant objects

## 2️⃣ Semantic Segmentation — SegFormer

Trained on Cityscapes

Pixel-wise classification into 19 semantic classes


📈 Key Results  
Best Validation mIoU:	~74%  
Training Resolution:	512 × 512  
Validation:	Full-resolution sliding window
